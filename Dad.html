  <h1>My Dad always hero....</h1>

<hr>
<p>Certain is it that there is no kind of affection so purely angelic as of a father to a daughter. In love to our wives there is desire; to our sons, ambition, but to our daughters there is something which there are no words to express.My Daddy was my hero.
   He was always there for me when I needed him. He listened to me and taught me so many things. 
   But most of all he was fun.</p>
